# loadBalancing
Designing an new Algorithm for load balancing on servers.

Me and my team have created an user interface with the help of JAVAFX so that you can add requests from each continent and also check the
results as in how these requests are handled by the servers in the cloud. Usually in cloud we make use standard algorithms to balance the
load(Ex. Max-Min,Min-Max,Honey Bee, Round robin etc.), so in our final year project we tried to create an standardised algorithm which will 
be efficient in terms of performance as well as in terms of cost. We call it the BUG's algorithm.


Just load the project in eclipse or IDEA or any Java (And JavaFX) supported IDE and run it.

Thank you
